<h1>
    Browser Wars
</h1>
<h3>A New Platform</h3>
<p1>In 1993 Marc Andreesen launched the first web browser known at the time as Mossaic. It launched a beta and quickly became viral. This piqued the interest of Jim Clark and soon him and Andreesen formed the company Netscape. The company grew with its roots, when Clark flew to the University of Illinois and recruited developers that would grow the web browser and expand the company’s growth. Many did not see the initial value of the web browser including the CEO of Microsoft, at the time the world’s largest technology company. In 1994 Netscape launched its newly created web browser known as Navigator. </p1>

<h3>The Giant</h3>
<p2>Microsoft eventually caught on to the hubris of Netscape. The web browser posed as an alternative to owning the software and application space which previously was owned with little competition by Microsoft’s Operating System platform. Bill Gates inevitably saw the threat that NetScape presented to Microsoft, and decided to act, leading to one of the most notable antitrust cases. Netscape and Microsoft both share different perspectives on the joint meeting held, which led to increased animosity between the two companies, and led to the staging of Netscapes suit on Microsoft. Netscape went public to gain money to try to compete with Microsoft and saw a massive demand for their IPO, which was unusual at the time for a company that had not had prior years of growth in profitability. Microsoft with its endless resources created a competitive alternative to NetScape’s web browser, known as Internet Explorer. Netscape eventually lost its success in the web browser space, but Microsoft did not end up winning either. Fortunately for Bill Gates, the courts decided that breaking the Monopoly of Microsoft was too harsh of a penalty, and Microsoft continued to grow but largely with out the same intensity that Bill Gates demanded as the CEO. Bill Gates transitioned in to spending more time with his foundation.</p2>
