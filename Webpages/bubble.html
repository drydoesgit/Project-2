<h1>
    The dot.com Bubble
</h1>

<p1>The dotcom bubble refers to a time period during the continuing evolution of Capitalism wherein digital ‘dot.com’ companies were given valuations by investors and shareholders at many-many multiples of their actual value relative to the companies earnings. This rapid increase in price evaluation was led by companies such as Ebay and Amazon which relied on new economic models based on rapid company-wide growth through debt financing instead of traditional revenue-led growth models. The change in growth models for digital companies is connected to traffic growth in that digital companies have a significant advantage of accessibility compared to traditional brick and mortar based locations which were traditionally limited to serving only people in close geographical proximity. This dynamic, in conjunction with Moore's law and Metcalf’s law, which state that the processing capacity (doubles every year) and node connectivity exacerbates the number of interconnections and interconnectivity (and thereby potential dependencies) resulted in a so called ‘upward spiral,’ wherein digital companies began to experience what in financial markets is referred to as contango- where future valuations are valued at more than present day tangible value. This led to a correspondent increase in stock prices for many digital companies, which in-turn led to a feeding-frenzy from venture capitalist to invest in even more digital companies, and while the vast majority of these companies would-and did fail, one or two (such as amazon and ebay) would go on to dominate the marketplace in accordance with the Pareto efficiency maximum (80/20 rule).

<h2> Dynamics of the bubble crash</h2>
<p2>The dynamic at play for the dot.com bubble was in large part a result of the inherent scalability of digital companies, as these companies relied on far fewer infrastructure requirements than traditional business models and therefore were able to grow at much higher multiples and attract larger and larger investments. Ultimately however, rapid growth does ensure profitability in the long-term, and the high turnover rate of newer companies entering into the marketplace and supplanting older ones lead to the collapse of many dot.com based businesses and a cascading chain of early internet startup failures, notably resulting in the 1999 dot.com bubble stock market crash. </p2>
