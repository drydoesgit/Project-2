                <p style="width: 250%;"><strong>Jeff Bezos'</strong> led Amazon in an innovative bussiness model that relied growth through debt financing
                    instead of traditional revenue-led growth models. This change represented a significant advantage for digital companies
                    as they had far more accessibility compared to traditional brick and mortar based store which were traditionally
                    limited to serving only people in close geographical proximity. </p>

                <p  style="width:250%;"><strong>Chad Hurley</strong> created youtube, a video streaming platform which revolutionized digital content
                    by allowing users to upload and edit digital videos from home, thereby changing everyday people from
                    simply being consumers of content, transforming them into producers of content themselves. A process
                    which completely flipped the traditional entertainment production model upside down. This inversion
                    was made possible primarily by breakthroughs in end-to-end encryption which allowed users to safely
                    purchase and store bank information online without fear of identity theft and helped usher
                    in the new era of the digital economy. </p>

                <p style="width:250%;"><strong>Sean Fanning</strong>is the creator of Napster, the music file sharing
                    service which became popular in the early 2000â€™s and resulted in high profile litigation between
                    record companies and musicians and their fan bases who enjoyed having access to music catalogs on
                    a digital platform for free. The core issue presented in the napster case was intellectual property
                    rights and a musicians right to license out their material. As a platform, Napster disrupted this model
                    by directly connecting music to listeners, completely removing the recording label from serving as the gatekeepers
                    of musicians intellectual property. </p>
