<div class="row">
    <div class="column"> The history of the internet: Internet search part 2 video documents how in the mid-to-late 1990’s,
        newly created internet companies such as Yahoo and Excite were the leading webpages for users. Early versions of
        these webpages were essentially directory navigation repositories that were manually configured by engineers.
        At these early stages, the issue with Internet Search for companies was in finding a way to monetize the directory
        functions without plastering web pages full of banner-ads, as such tactics often led to unfavorable user experiences.
        It wasn't until Larry Page and Sergey Brim started the google search engine- a search page that ranked output displays
        based on a numeric value ranking of the most frequently viewed pages, or as described by Page himself:
        “in essence google interprets a link from page A to B as a vote b page A for page B,” that the data of what users where actually
        ‘searching’ for began to be seen as valuable insight into the preferences of consumers and therefore,
        a valuable asset for marketing and advertising companies  </div>
